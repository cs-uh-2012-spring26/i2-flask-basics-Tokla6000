## Branch Naming Conventions

To maintain a clean and organized repository, you can adopt these branch naming conventions:

- `feature/<member-initials-or-name>/<description>`: For new features (e.g., `feature/john-doe/user-authentication`)
- `bugfix/<member-initials-or-name>/<description>`: For bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/jdoe/fix-login-error`)
- `maint/<member-initials-or-name>/<description>`: For maintenance tasks such as updating documentation, refactorings etc (e.g., `maint/johnd/update-docs`)
